    <h4>&lt;description></h4>
    <h3>Palindromes are cool!</h3>
    <p>For this program, you will check if the user's input is in fact
      a palindrome (e.g. ABBA, or racecar, or tacocat). When checking if
      something is a palindrome, you typically strip out any non-letter
      symbols, including whitespace characters (whitespace characters
      include actual spaces, a return/enter, and tabs).
    </p>

    <p>We are going to do two versions: an easy (well, easier) and a hard
      version.
    </p>
    <h4>The Easy Version</h4>
    <p>For this version, check the user input to see if it's a palindrome.
      Assume that there are only letters in the input. <strong>However,
      it should not matter if the user entered lower or upper case
      letters. AbBa is still a palindrom, as is Racecar. </strong>
      For the easy version, you only need to complete the isPalindrome()
      function that has been setup in the script tag below. Ignore the
      cleanString() function for now.
    </p>
    <h4>The Hard Version</h4>
    <p>For the second version, we will allow the user to enter
      punctuation, whitespace characters, etc. and we will still
      determine if the input is in fact a palindrome. Complete the easy
      version first since we'll use the code from the easy version in
      the hard version. <strong>For the hard version, we will strip out
      the following symbols: space, comma, period, exclamation mark,
      question mark, colon, and semi-colon. We could add more, but
      this is enough...</strong>. To complete the hard version, you
      should only need to write the cleanString() function so that
      it removes the indicated characters and returns a "cleaned"
      string. If sent the string "Hey, what is that?", the cleanString()
      function should return "Heywhatisthat". The cleanString() 
      function should NOT change the case of any letters; it should
      only remove the indicated characters.
    </p>

    <h4>&lt;/description></h4>

    <input type="button" onclick="check()" value="Check Pal">

      function check() {
        //basic plan
        //1 get the value from the user
        //2 clean the string (ignore this step for the first version)
        //3 check if it's a palindrome and repor the answer

        //1 Get input
        let value = document.getElementById("input").value;

        //2 Clean string...function returns a cleaned-up version
        value = cleanString(value)

        //3 Check and report answer
        if( isPalindrome(value) ) {
          alert("It looks like " + value + " is a palindrome!");
        }
        else {
          alert("Nope! " + value + " is NOT a palindrome");
        }
      }


      //This function should return true if the parameter str
      //is a palindrome and false otherwise
      function isPalindrome(str) {
        //it is really bad right now...make it better :)
        str = str.toLowerCase()

        return str === reversed
      }

      //the parameter and return the "cleaned up" version
      function cleanString(str) {
        //it is also bad at its job at first...it does no cleaning
        let clean = ""
        for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
            let char = str[i]
            if((char >= "a" && char <= "z") || (char >= "A" && char <= "Z")) {
                clean += char
